Free Fluid Barriers Rotor for Synchronous Reluctance Motor Drawing

`SynRM`, `SyRM`, `SynchRM`, `REL`, `SynchRel`,
`PMASynRM`, `PMASyRM`, `PMASynchRM`, `PMAREL`, `PMASynchRel`


## Goal

Provide a ready-to-use fully parametric drawing of the
Synchronous Reluctance Rotor with *fluid* flux-barriers.



## Requirements

Matlab or Octave to compute the points. 
The points calculation is general, so it could be implemented in any
language, but I chose Matlab/Octave because it is my standard 
interface with [FEMM](www.femm.info) software.

If you do not use FEMM, you can still use the calculation part and
make a porting for your CAD engine or FEA software.
If you do so, consider contributing to the project adding your 
interface scripting.



## ETA

Weeks or months, starting March 2018.
